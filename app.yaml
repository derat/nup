# The skip\_files documentation is a self-contradictory mess:
#
# https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref:
#   "Note that skip\_files compares absolute paths."
#   "Filenames are relative to the project directory."
# https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/testing-and-deploying-your-app:
#   "Note: You cannot specify the skip\_files field in your app.yaml file if you
#    have a .gcloudignore file."
#
# As far as I can tell (using google-cloud-sdk-app-engine-python 365.0.0-0), a
# skip\_files directive convinces dev_appserver.py not to rebuild unnecessarily
# even when there's a .gcloudignore file, and the regular expressions need to
# fully match absolute paths (".*/nup/(client|cmd|example|mp3gain|test)/.*").
#
# None of this matters, though, since "gcloud beta app deploy" fails if
# skip\_files is set:
#
#   ERROR: (gcloud.beta.app.deploy) skip|_files cannot be used with the [go115]
#   runtime. Ignore patterns are instead expressed in a .gcloudignore file. For
#   information on the format and syntax of .gcloudignore files, see
#   https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/topic/gcloudignore.
#
# skip\_files (without a backslash in the middle of it) is so forbidden that I'm
# not even allowed to mention it in comments!
#
# This is unfortunate, since dev_appserver.py doesn't seem to honor
# .gcloudignore for the purpose of skipping rebuilds.
